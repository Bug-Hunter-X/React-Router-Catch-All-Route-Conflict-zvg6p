This repository demonstrates a common issue in React Router v6 where a catch-all route (`/*`) interferes with other route definitions.  The problem arises when the catch-all route is not placed last in the route definition.  This leads to the catch-all route always being matched, regardless of other matching routes. The solution involves carefully ordering routes to ensure correct matching behavior.
